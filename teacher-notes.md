## Reflections for students

- Think about why we use NODE_ENV=test and `todos_test` as the database.
- How could we speed up these tests? What are the downsides to each approach? (i.e. parallelism, fixtures, mocking)
- What would we have to do to parallelize the tests? (e.g. multiple DBs)
- What would you refactor? What was annoying to type, hard to understand, repetitive, easy to forget?
